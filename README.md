# Some sample code written by Jose Deodoro

Unfortunately most of the stuff I work with is proprietary code, and I never seem to have time to help open source projects. Thus, this repository contains a bit of the stuff I do at home for myself, and some stuff I am able to disclose, in order to have some work to show companies during interviews.
